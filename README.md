# Sensebar
Game Controller for Disabled


How to use Mapper:
	1. Install pygame & python2.7 on your computer
	2. Run python2.7 Mapping.py
	3. It will open up a GUI that asks for a Key to press that can be mapped to the Sensebar.
	4. Once you select all the keys for the controller press Enter to generate Mapper.ino file & it will ouput the generated file on the standard output.
	5. Copy Mapper.ino to the Mapper Folder and replace the existing one to override it.
	6. Copy Mapper/ folder to Arduino/ folder.
	7. Compile and Upload Mapper.ino in Arduino application. ( Make sure you select Arduino Leonardo as the board)
	8. Pull up a game, connect Sensebar to that machine and you can start playing it.

Thank you.
